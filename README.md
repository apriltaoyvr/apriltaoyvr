👋 Hi, I’m April Tao

🌹 I'm interested in UI/UX design, web design, and web development. I'll (hopefully) be attending BCIT's New Media and Development program. 

🌎 I'm from Vancouver 🇨🇦 but I travel quite often! My dream is to study in Paris and to be fluent in French 🇫🇷

🐈 Aside from that, I love beautiful things. Pigeons, rats, and cats are some of my favourites. And I have a passing interest in fashion and painting.
